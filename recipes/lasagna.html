    <p>Some recipes take a little more time to make but are so worth the effort â€” like <strong>lasagna.</strong></p> 
        <p>This versatile Italian dish can be labor-intensive, but the prep is worth it for the delicious final product.</p>
        <p><em><strong>(It's no wonder Garfield the cat loved them so much.)</strong></em></p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li> <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li> <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li> <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li> <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li> <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li> <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
